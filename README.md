# PyNES

## NES Emulator Written in Python 3

This project was inspired by watching the Youtube/Twitch series by PyAndy about coding an NES Emulator from scratch in Python 3.

I like Python, I like NES games, and I like learning about things, so I decided to try and code along with Andy and build my own.
